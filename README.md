# DIY Power Station
This repo shows the progress of two young doughnuts building a power station for off-grid outdoor DJ music sessions with the lads.

We're building a **280Ah 12V power station able to withstand 1500W**. These were the specs we found best suited our needs. Since we are powering two speakers, a laptop, DJ mixer and lights, this gig is expected to give around 10 hours of non-stop tunes :notes:.
